/**
 * A version of SSLTrack which is registered in a global cache. This enables
 * expensive derived properties, such as track length calculated using GetID3,
 * to be reported back to the cache which can carry these values forward
 * into new instances of SSLTrack that represent the same row but in different
 * states, so that it's unneccessary to calculate these values more than once.

     * This version of setLengthIfUnknown() looks in the cache that the track was
     * constructed with for a track with the same row ID. If it finds one, it 
     * inquired if this (possibly expensive) question has already been answered.
     * If it has, we use the answer from the cache.
     * 
     * If no answer is found in the cache, we fall back to scanning the file with
     * getID3 in the usual way. If results are found we are sure to poke them 
     * back in to the cache.
     * 
     * This is necessary because ScratchLive! can create several objects for the
     * same row (as it will write multiple, updated, versions of the row to the
     * history file over time). Several of these may be missing expensive info,
     * so we want to cache it from object to object.
